# SpringJDBC-with-h2

H2 is a lightweight, open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) written in Java. It is often used for development, testing, and small-scale applications due to its in-memory mode, fast performance, and easy setup.

### Key Features of H2 Database:

``Lightweight & Fast – Small footprint and optimized for speed.``

``In-Memory Mode – Can run entirely in RAM, making it ideal for temporary or test databases.``

``Embedded & Server Modes – Can be used as an embedded database (within an application) or as a standalone server.``

``SQL Compatibility – Supports standard SQL and JDBC.``

``Zero Configuration – No complex setup required; works with minimal configuration.``

``MVCC Support – Uses Multi-Version Concurrency Control for high performance.``

``File-based Persistence – Can store data in a file if needed.``

``Web Console – Provides a simple web-based interface for managing the database.``

### Common Use Cases:

``Development and testing environments.``

``Java applications (often used with Spring Boot).``

``Small-scale applications needing an embedded database.``

``Prototyping before moving to a production-grade RDBMS like MySQL or PostgreSQL.``
